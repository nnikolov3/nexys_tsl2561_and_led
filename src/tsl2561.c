/*
 * tsl2561.c - Driver implementation for TSL2561 Luminosity Sensor
 *
 * Purpose: This driver interfaces with the TSL2561 sensor over I2C to measure
 *          ambient light intensity (lux). It initializes the sensor, reads raw
 *          data from its channels (visible + IR and IR-only), and converts the
 *          readings into lux values. The driver is used in a FreeRTOS-based
 *          PID control system to maintain a target light level by adjusting an
 *          LED's PWM duty cycle.
 *
 * Course:  ECE 544 - Embedded Systems Design, Winter 2025
 * Authors: Nikolay Nikolov, Ashten Bontrager

/*
 * TSL2561 Initialization Notes:
 *
 * After applying VDD, the device will initially be in the power-down state. To
 * operate the device, issue a command to access the CONTROL register followed
 * by the data value 03h to power up the device. At this point, both ADC
 * channels will begin a conversion at the default integration time of 400 ms.
 * After 400 ms, the conversion results will be available in the DATA0 and
 * DATA1 registers.
